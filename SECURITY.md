## Security Patches
Security vulnerabilities will be patched as soon as responsibly possible, and published as an advisory on this repository (see [advisories]) and on the affected packages.Projects that build on Infrared Finance Contracts are encouraged to clearly state, in their source code and websites, how to be contacted about security issues in the event that a direct notification is considered necessary. We recommend including it in the NatSpec for the contract as /// @custom:security-contact security@example.com.Additionally, we recommend installing the library through appropriate package managers and setting up vulnerability alerts such as [Dependabot].
